# Luau Core Language: Full Reference

This reference covers the language plus the Roblox-facing facts agents need most often: engine deprecations, sandbox deltas from Lua 5.1, the native codegen directives, and Roblox naming conventions. Deeper engine behavior belongs in the domain skills.

## 1. Values, truthiness, and equality

Only `false` and `nil` are falsy. Zero, empty strings, and empty tables are truthy.

```luau
if 0 then
    print("runs")
end

print(0 == "0") -- false
print(1 == true) -- false
```

Equality does not coerce between numbers, strings, and booleans. Inequality is `~=`. Use explicit empty or zero checks when those values are invalid.

The common fallback expression `value or defaultValue` replaces both `nil` and `false`. If `false` is valid, test for `nil` explicitly.

```luau
local result = if value == nil then defaultValue else value
```

Prefer Luau's `if` expression when the true branch could be `false` or `nil`. The older `condition and trueValue or falseValue` idiom cannot preserve a falsy true value.

## 2. Tables are several shapes, not one promise

A table can represent a sequence, dictionary, record, set, object, or module. Choose one shape intentionally.

```luau
local sequence = { "first", "second" }
local record = { name = "Ada", score = 10 }
local dictionary: {[number]: string} = {}
dictionary[userId] = "Ada"
local set: {[string]: boolean} = { admin = true }
```

Array conventions are 1-based. The length operator is useful for a contiguous sequence. Once a numeric-keyed table has nil gaps, do not rely on `#table` as a count or boundary.

Assigning `nil` removes a key. Use `table.remove(sequence, index)` when removing from the middle of a sequence and preserving contiguity matters.

Dot syntax is literal field syntax. Dynamic keys require brackets:

```luau
local field = "score"
print(record[field])
```

Dictionary iteration order is unspecified. Sort explicit keys or values before emitting stable output.

### `__newindex` fires only for keys the table does not have

An assignment goes through `__newindex` only when the key is absent from the raw table. Once a key exists — including after a single `rawset` inside the hook — later writes bypass the hook while that raw key remains present (verified against the Luau runtime, 2026-10):

```luau
local log = {}
local t = setmetatable({}, { __newindex = function(tbl, key, value)
	table.insert(log, key)
	rawset(tbl, key, value) -- the write itself must not re-enter the hook
end })
t.a = 1 -- hook runs
t.a = 2 -- raw write: key now exists, hook does NOT run
```

Two consequences:

- Inside `__newindex`, write with `rawset` or to a separate table. A plain `tbl[key] = value` on an absent key re-enters the hook recursively.
- A hook that must observe *every* write cannot let the exposed table ever hold the data. Keep the exposed table permanently empty and store the value elsewhere (`store[key] = value` inside the hook); every write then hits the hook because no raw key ever becomes present.

## 3. Reference and copy semantics

Tables are references. Assignment aliases the same table.

```luau
local original = { score = 10, nested = { enabled = true } }
local alias = original
alias.score = 20
print(original.score) -- 20
```

`table.clone` creates a shallow copy. Nested tables remain shared.

```luau
local copy = table.clone(original)
copy.score = 30
copy.nested.enabled = false -- also changes original.nested.enabled
```

Do not add a generic recursive deep-copy helper without defining how it handles metatables, cycles, shared subgraphs, Instances, and unsupported keys. Copy only the data shape the caller owns.

`table.freeze` prevents writes to that table, not recursively to all nested tables. Treat it as one boundary, not deep immutability.

### Immutable updates via path copying

Practitioner design, informed by [Kampfkarren’s guidelines](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kampfkarren/kampfkarren-luau-guidelines/main/README.md); independently written here. For tree-shaped immutable state, clone each table along the changed path instead of deep-copying unrelated branches:

```luau
local settings = { audio = { volume = 0.8 }, video = { shadows = true } }
local updated = table.clone(settings)
updated.audio = table.clone(settings.audio)
updated.audio.volume = 0.4 -- settings.audio.volume remains 0.8
```

Unchanged branches retain identity and can be shared only while they remain immutable. Cloning cost depends on the sizes of the tables copied, not just path depth. This is not a replacement for independent mutable snapshots: aliases and cycles need an explicit ownership policy. Existing deep-copy requirements for mutable player defaults still apply; see `roblox-data`.

## 4. Iteration and mutation

Generalized iteration is valid Luau:

```luau
for index, value in sequence do
    print(index, value)
end

for key, value in dictionary do
    print(key, value)
end
```

Use numeric loops when index range is the contract. Avoid removing sequence elements while iterating forward because indices shift. Iterate backward, record removals, or build a filtered result.

```luau
for index = #sequence, 1, -1 do
    if shouldRemove(sequence[index]) then
        table.remove(sequence, index)
    end
end
```

`table.find` searches array values and returns an index or nil. It does not search dictionary keys or apply a predicate. `table.sort` mutates the sequence and its comparator must define a consistent strict order.

## 5. Scope, functions, and multiple values

A local name is visible from its declaration onward. Code above a local declaration does not capture that later local.

A `repeat … until` condition can see locals declared inside its body; those locals do not escape the loop. The body runs at least once, and the loop stops when the condition is **true**, unlike `while`. Source: [control structures](https://create.roblox.com/docs/luau/control-structures).

```luau
local second

local function first(value: number)
    if value > 0 then
        second(value - 1)
    end
end

function second(value: number)
    if value > 0 then
        first(value - 1)
    end
end
```

Forward declaration is appropriate for mutual recursion. Otherwise place a callee before its callers.

Functions can return multiple values. Context can keep or discard them:

```luau
local function divide(a: number, b: number): (number?, string?)
    if b == 0 then
        return nil, "division by zero"
    end
    return a / b, nil
end

local quotient, problem = divide(6, 2)
```

Parentheses and table constructors affect multiple-value expansion. When this matters, assign the values explicitly rather than relying on terse expression behavior.

Missing arguments are `nil`; extra arguments can be ignored. A function that requires arity or non-nil inputs must validate or express that contract through types and call structure.

Loop variables in a numeric or generic `for` have iteration-local behavior. Variables mutated outside the loop are shared by closures. Capture the intended value in a new local when ownership is unclear.

### `const` bindings

<!-- temporal: 2026-03 -->
`const` was added in Luau 0.711 (March 2026). Older tooling and lint stubs may reject it; the keyword is valid ([release notes](https://github.com/luau-lang/luau/releases/tag/0.711), [RFC](https://github.com/luau-lang/rfcs/blob/master/docs/const-keyword.md)).

```luau
const maxRetries = 3
-- maxRetries = 5 -- rejected at compile time: constant rebinding

const config = { speed = 16 } -- the binding is frozen, not the table
config.speed = 20 -- allowed; use table.freeze for value immutability
```

A `const` binding freezes the name, not the value; it applies to the binding like `local`, and the table itself stays mutable unless frozen. It is a contextual keyword, valid only where `local` is. `const` must be initialized at declaration. Prefer `const` for module-level values and constants that must never be rebound; it lets the typechecker and tools treat the symbol as stable.

## 6. Method syntax

A colon adds an implicit first argument named `self`.

```luau
function object:move(amount)
    self.position += amount
end

object:move(2)
-- equivalent call shape: object.move(object, 2)
```

A dot does not add `self`. Define and call a function consistently. Constructors and module functions usually use dot syntax; instance methods usually use colon syntax.

Metatable object design and lifecycle belong in `roblox-luau-patterns`.

## 7. Strings and patterns

### Literal search, splitting, and byte-oriented operations

Use existing [standard library](https://luau.org/library) functions before inventing parsing helpers:

- `string.find(text, needle, 1, true)` performs literal search. Without the fourth argument, punctuation in the needle may act as pattern syntax. Prefer literal search for user-supplied search text.
- `string.split(text, separator)` uses a literal separator, not a pattern; the default separator is comma. An empty separator splits **bytes**, not Unicode characters.
- `string.reverse` reverses bytes and can corrupt UTF-8. `string.lower`/`upper` handle ASCII case, not international case folding. Do not use these as Unicode-aware display or name normalization.
- `string.format` supports field width/precision, e.g. `%.2f`; it is not locale-aware number formatting.
- `string.pack`/`unpack` provide binary strings; `packsize` reports a fixed format's size. Use an explicit layout and byte order rather than assuming host sizes. Prefer the existing `buffer` guidance when mutable binary storage is needed.


Backtick interpolation and `..` concatenation are both valid:

```luau
local message = `{name} reached {score}`
local path = prefix .. "/" .. suffix
```

Use the clearer form. When assembling many pieces in a loop, collect fragments in a sequence and call `table.concat` once if measurements show allocation matters.

Luau uses Lua-style string patterns, not regular expressions. Do not paste regex syntax and assume equivalent behavior.

Common classes include `%a` letters, `%d` digits, `%w` alphanumeric, and `%s` whitespace. Uppercase forms negate a class. Pattern magic characters must be escaped according to Lua pattern rules.

```luau
local year, month, day = string.match("2026-07-26", "^(%d+)-(%d+)-(%d+)$")
local compact = string.gsub("too   wide", "%s+", " ")
for word in string.gmatch("one two", "%S+") do
    print(word)
end
```

A plausible-looking email regex translated into a Lua pattern is not robust email validation. Validate only the format the product actually needs.

### Equality dispatch with `__eq`

The `__eq` hook is consulted only when both operands carry the *same* handler function (sharing one metatable is a simple way to ensure this). With a handler present, `x == x` also reaches the handler — Luau does not short-circuit self-comparison once `__eq` exists. When the two operands have different `__eq` handlers, Luau calls neither and falls back to raw identity; a handler on only one side is likewise ignored. All of this is live Luau behavior (probed 2026-10), not Lua 5.1 semantics:

```luau
local Vec = {}
Vec.__index = Vec
Vec.__eq = function(a, b)
	if rawequal(a, b) then -- identity check must not recursively invoke __eq
		return true
	end
	return a.x == b.x and a.y == b.y
end
```

The handler's return is coerced to a boolean: any non-nil/non-false value counts as equal, `nil`/`false` as unequal. Consequences:

- Two classes that each define their own `__eq` cannot ever compare equal across types — the cross-type comparison silently ignores both handlers. Share one metatable per type.
- Put an identity check at the top of expensive handlers; it runs even for `x == x`.
- `rawequal(a, b)` never dispatches `__eq`; use it for identity checks that must not run user code.

### Library operations ignore metamethods

`#` honors `__len`; `rawlen`, `ipairs`, `pairs`, `table.insert`, and `table.concat` operate on raw storage. Generalized `for ... in t` is different: it can call `__iter`. Do not assume a custom iterator changes how `pairs` or the table library sees a proxy. A proxy whose elements live only behind `__index` iterates as empty and concatenates to `""`; `table.insert(proxy, v)` writes raw storage and skips `__newindex` (all probed 2026-10). Consequences:

- A read-only view or tracking proxy must keep the real data in a raw field (or the backing table) and iterate *that*; iterating the proxy itself finds nothing.
- `rawlen(t)` is the deliberate raw-length read; keep `__len` off tables that are also used as sequences, or length checks in library calls will disagree with `#`.
- There is no `__pairs` dispatch in Luau; `pairs` cannot be redirected.

## 8. Numeric behavior

Luau provides ordinary arithmetic, compound assignment such as `+=`, and floor division `//`. Be explicit around division by zero, negative values, clamping, and units.

`NaN` propagates through arithmetic and is unequal to everything including itself. Range guards written as `if v < min or v > max` silently accept NaN because both comparisons are false. Guard with `v ~= v`.

Floor division `//` truncates toward negative infinity (`-7 // 2 == -4`). `0/0` is NaN.

### buffer library

- Fixed-size binary data without table overhead: `buffer.create(size)`, then read/write typed values at offsets.
- Offsets are 0-based, sizes in bytes. Out-of-range access errors; the buffer does not grow.
- The function name selects width and numeric representation (`readu8`/`readi16`/`readf32` family); byte order is fixed, not a selectable argument.
- Multibyte numeric reads/writes are little-endian; signed integers use two's complement ([luau.org/library](https://luau.org/library)); matters whenever buffer contents cross to an external format.
- `buffer.readinteger`/`buffer.writeinteger` are 64-bit integer APIs behind the upstream `LuauIntegerLibrary` flag ([runtime source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luau-lang/luau/master/VM/src/lbuflib.cpp)). They are present in the local standalone CLI used for these probes, but are not listed in the Roblox buffer reference checked in 2026-10. Do not infer Roblox availability from a standalone CLI or from missing web documentation; verify the target runtime before using them.

Two failure modes behave oppositely — this is the part agents get wrong:

- **Out-of-bounds access errors loudly** (`buffer access out of bounds`): bad offset arithmetic is caught at the call.
- **A wrong-width read can silently succeed if it stays in bounds.** `readu16` on a slot written as `u32` returns the low bytes, not a schema-mismatch error. `f32` also rounds: a `writef32`/`readf32` roundtrip of `0.1` does not compare equal to the original double. Choose `f32` or `f64` for the required precision; neither makes arbitrary decimal values exact. Out-of-range integer *writes* are also silent, taking the value's least significant bits (`writeu8(b, 0, 300)` stores 44).

Decision rule: all offset and width arithmetic lives inside `get`/`set` helpers keyed by field name; no call site ever computes an offset or picks a width inline.

```luau
local bounded = math.clamp(value, minimum, maximum)
local whole = numerator // denominator
```

Floating-point equality is often the wrong test for derived values. Use a tolerance selected from the domain, not one universal epsilon.

Do not normalize a zero-length vector without deciding the fallback direction. Roblox datatype math belongs in the relevant camera, physics, or building skill.

### math library quick map

One-line semantics; full reference at [luau.org/library](https://luau.org/library). Angles are radians; use `math.rad`/`math.deg` to convert.

- `math.abs`, `math.floor`, `math.ceil`, `math.sqrt` (NaN on negative input), `math.exp`, `math.log(n, base?)` (base defaults to e; NaN on negative, `-inf` on 0), `math.log10(n)`.
- Trig: `math.sin`/`math.cos`/`math.tan` take radians; `math.asin`/`math.acos` return NaN outside `[-1, 1]`; `math.atan2(y, x)` resolves the quadrant from both signs (range `[-pi, pi]`) and is the correct angle from a displacement, not `math.atan(y/x)` which loses quadrant. Hyperbolic: `sinh`, `cosh`, `tanh`. `math.atan(n)` returns `[-pi/2, pi/2]`.
- `math.round` rounds to nearest, halfway away from zero; `math.floor`/`math.ceil` bound it. `math.fmod(x, y)` truncates toward zero and returns NaN when y is 0, unlike `x % y` which follows the sign of y. `math.modf(n)` returns integer and fractional parts, both with the input's sign. `math.frexp`/`math.ldexp` split/rebuild a significand and binary exponent.
- `math.clamp(n, min, max)` errors when `min > max`. `math.sign(n)` is `-1`/`1`/`0` (0 for NaN too). `math.max`/`math.min` require at least one argument and error otherwise.
- `math.random()` returns `[0, 1]`; `math.random(n)` returns `[1, n]`; `math.random(min, max)` returns `[min, max]`. Arguments are truncated to integers, so `math.random(1.5)` always returns 1. `math.randomseed(seed)` reseeds the generator for a deterministic sequence.
- `math.isnan`, `math.isinf`, `math.isfinite` classify problem values without `x ~= x` tricks.
- `math.noise(x, y?, z?)` is 3D Perlin noise, roughly `[-1, 1]`, inputs defaulting to 0. Smooth; use for procedural terrain and variation, not as a hash. For whole-terrain generation prefer a dedicated terrain or noise skill.
- Luau adds `math.lerp(a, b, t)` (`a + (b - a) * t`; at exactly `t == 1` returns `b`) and `math.map(x, inMin, inMax, outMin, outMax)` (linear range remap); neither exists in plain Lua 5.x.

### EncodingService

Roblox's engine service for Base64, hashing, and compression: `game:GetService("EncodingService")`. It operates on `buffer` values (use `buffer.fromstring`/`buffer.tostring` to convert), not strings, except the string hash. Docs: [EncodingService](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/EncodingService). <!-- temporal: 2026-08 -->

- `EncodingService:Base64Encode(input: buffer): buffer` and `:Base64Decode(input: buffer): buffer` (decode throws on invalid input).
- `EncodingService:ComputeBufferHash(input: buffer, algorithm: HashAlgorithm): buffer` and `:ComputeStringHash(input: string, algorithm: HashAlgorithm): string`. These are fast hashes (the `HashAlgorithm` enum), not password hashes or key derivation; use server-validated tokens or an external KDF for credential purposes.
- `EncodingService:CompressBuffer(input, CompressionAlgorithm, compressionLevel?)`: Zstd levels -7 to 22; higher compresses more, costs more time.
- `EncodingService:DecompressBuffer(input, CompressionAlgorithm)` throws when the size header is missing/corrupt or exceeds 1GB. For untrusted compressed data (e.g. from a client RemoteEvent), call `:GetDecompressedBufferSize(input, algorithm)` first; when it returns nil, refuse to decompress. Cap sizes by input source: compression amplification is a DoS vector.
- This is the engine alternative to hand-rolled Base64 or `HttpService:JSONEncode` misuse for binary payloads. For JSON, still use `HttpService`; EncodingService is for bytes.


## 9. Cross-language translation traps

### JavaScript to Luau

- `===` becomes `==`; `!==` becomes `~=`.
- `null` and `undefined` do not map to two separate values; Luau uses `nil`.
- Arrow functions, optional chaining, nullish coalescing, and spread syntax are not Luau syntax. JS `const`/`let` are unrelated to Luau's `const` keyword (a binding-freezing declaration added in 0.711) and there is no `let` at all.
- Array `.map`, `.filter`, `.find(predicate)`, `.push`, and `.length` are not methods on Luau tables.
- Object property enumeration order is not a portable dictionary-order contract.
- `try/catch` is not syntax; fallible execution uses `pcall` or `xpcall`, with domain-specific recovery.
- `async/await` is not syntax. Scheduling and Promise libraries belong in `roblox-luau-patterns`.

### Python to Luau

- Sequences conventionally start at 1, not 0.
- `None`, `True`, `False`, `elif`, list comprehensions, decorators, and exception syntax do not translate directly.
- Dictionaries, lists, objects, and sets can all be represented with tables, but their invariants must be stated.
- Tuple-like multiple returns are language behavior, not a single tuple object.
- Indentation does not delimit blocks; `then`, `do`, and `end` do.

Translate the data model and control flow, not token by token.

## 10. Deprecated and inherited APIs

Roblox deprecation is a spectrum. **Deprecated** here means the API carries an official Deprecated tag (creator docs show it struck through). **Discouraged** means it works today, has no tag, but Roblox documents a reason to avoid it. Both get replacements; only the first group will ever show deprecation tooling.

<!-- temporal: 2026-09 -->
Verify current tags against the class pages before quoting them in reviews; Roblox adds tags over time and legacy globals live in [Roblox globals](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/globals/RobloxGlobals).

### Officially deprecated (tagged)

| Deprecated | Replacement | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `wait(seconds)` | `task.wait(seconds)` | Old global throttles to ~29 ms minimum and returns `(elapsed, gameTime)`; `task.wait` resumes on the next Heartbeat step without throttling. |
| `spawn(f)` | `task.spawn(f)` | Old global throttles the first resumption and passes extra args; `task.spawn` runs immediately. |
| `delay(t, f)` | `task.delay(t, f)` | Same throttling issues as `spawn`. |
| `:connect` / `:wait` (lowercase) | `:Connect` / `:Wait` | Legacy lowercase aliases on `RBXScriptSignal`; PascalCase names are canonical and get new behavior. |
| `BodyPosition` | `AlignPosition` | Legacy `BodyMover` family, all deprecated. |
| `BodyGyro` | `AlignOrientation` | |
| `BodyVelocity` | `LinearVelocity` | |
| `BodyForce`, `BodyThrust` | `VectorForce` | |
| `BodyAngularVelocity` | `AngularVelocity` (or `Torque`) | |
| `RocketPropulsion` | `LineForce` / `AlignPosition` + `AlignOrientation` | |
| `Humanoid:LoadAnimation` | `Animator:LoadAnimation` | Create the `Animator` on the server; calling the deprecated method from a client can create a client-only `Animator` that never replicates. Same applies to `AnimationController:LoadAnimation`. |
| `Part.Velocity` / `Part.RotVelocity` | `AssemblyLinearVelocity` / `AssemblyAngularVelocity` | Assembly-level physics; per-part behavior was inconsistent for non-root parts. Use `BasePart:GetVelocityAtPosition()` for a specific point. |
| `Model:SetPrimaryPartCFrame` | `PVInstance:PivotTo` | `GetPrimaryPartCFrame` → `PVInstance:GetPivot`. `PivotTo` needs no `PrimaryPart` and preserves offsets. |

Roblox's own deprecated-to-modern quick reference (creator docs `reference/engine/llms.txt`) confirms the mover and task rows above.

### Functional but discouraged (no official tag)

| API | Why discouraged | Use instead |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tick()` | Not officially deprecated, but can be off by up to one second and returns inconsistent results across time zones and operating systems (Roblox's own docs say this). | `os.time()` (Unix seconds), `os.clock()` (benchmarks), global `time()` (session time), `workspace:GetServerTimeNow()` (synced), `DateTime` for timestamps. |
| `Instance.new(class, parent)` | Works, but the docs mark the parent argument as not recommended: parenting first makes every later property write replicate and re-run listeners. | Create, set properties, then assign `.Parent` last. Setting parent in the constructor is acceptable only when no properties are set afterwards or the parent is not yet replicated. |

Treat "deprecated" and "discouraged" as distinct when editing code: rewrite deprecated calls, and flag discouraged ones only when the surrounding code is already being touched.

## 11. Luau sandbox versus Lua 5.1

Luau starts from Lua 5.1 and subtracts. When porting Lua code or answering "why is X missing," these removals are intentional sandbox design, not bugs (sources: [luau.org/sandbox](https://luau.org/sandbox), [Luau globals](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/globals/LuaGlobals)).

| Removed or reduced | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| `io` library | Removed entirely (file and process access). |
| `package` library | Removed entirely (native module loading). |
| `dofile` / `loadfile` | Removed (filesystem access). |
| `string.dump` | Removed; bytecode access is unsafe to validate. `loadstring` accepts source only, never bytecode. |
| `debug` library | Removed to a large extent; only `debug.traceback` and `debug.info` remain. |
| `os` | Reduced to `os.clock`, `os.date`, `os.difftime`, `os.time`. No `os.execute`, `os.exit`, `os.getenv`, `os.rename`, `os.remove`, `os.tmpname`. |
| `collectgarbage` | Only `"count"` works; other options are rejected because GC manipulation breaks isolation. `collectgarbage()` is effectively a weaker `gcinfo()` and deprecated in Roblox. |
| `newproxy` | Accepts `nil`/`false` (bare userdata) or `true` (empty metatable); the generator-function form is gone. |
| Builtin globals | Libraries, the string metatable, and the builtin globals table are read-only; monkey-patching `string` or `_G` builtin tables fails. Each script gets its own globals table that reads through to the builtins, so per-script globals still work. |
| `getfenv` / `setfenv` | Still present (legacy code relies on them) but costly to isolation: they can inject globals into callers on the stack. Avoid in new code; `debug.info`/upvalues and module returns cover the legitimate cases. |
| Yield restrictions | A `coroutine.yield` attempted inside a metamethod raises `attempt to yield across metamethod/C-call boundary` (probed 2026-10). An uncaught error terminates the coroutine. A `pcall` inside the metamethod can catch the error and let execution continue, but cannot make the yield succeed. `pcall`/`xpcall` themselves are the C-function boundaries you *can* yield across from ordinary code. If an `__index` hook needs data that requires waiting, make the wait explicit at the call site instead of yielding inside the hook. |

## 12. The vector library

Luau's native `vector` type underlies `Vector3`-style math. In Roblox, the library is the 3-wide VM type that `Vector3` interoperates with; the library itself is small ([luau.org/library](https://luau.org/library)).

```luau
local v = vector.create(1, 2, 3)
local m = vector.magnitude(v)
local n = vector.normalize(v)
local d = vector.dot(v, n)
local c = vector.cross(v, n)
local a = vector.angle(v, n)
local l = vector.lerp(v, n, 0.5)
-- componentwise: vector.floor / ceil / abs / sign / clamp / min / max
-- constants: vector.zero, vector.one
```

- Components are `x`/`y`/`z` (case-insensitive access); vectors are immutable, so there is no component write.
- Operator support: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, unary minus, and indexing are built into the VM, which is why vector math is fast under `--!native`.
- `vector.lerp(vec1, vec2, alpha)` linearly interpolates component-wise between the two vectors; `alpha` is not clamped to `[0, 1]` (values outside extrapolate). Do not confuse this Luau library function with Roblox's engine `Vector3` datatype, which uses the method form `Vector3:Lerp(goal, alpha)`.
- 4-wide mode (`LUA_VECTOR_SIZE`) exists for other embedders, not for Roblox, which is 3-wide.

## 13. Naming conventions

Roblox's official Lua style guide ([roblox.github.io/lua-style-guide](https://roblox.github.io/lua-style-guide/), verified 2026-09) sets the house conventions for Luau code:

| Construct | Convention | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Classes, enum-like objects, module publics | `PascalCase` | `DataLoader`, `RobuxShop` |
| Locals, member values, functions | `camelCase` | `currentRound`, `beginVote()` |
| Local constants | `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` | `MAX_RETRIES = 5` |
| Private members | underscore-prefixed camelCase | `_connection` |
| Acronyms inside a name | Only capitalize the first letter | `aJsonVariable`, `MakeHttpCall` |
| Abbreviation as a set | Keep it fully capitalized | `anRGBValue`, `GetXYZ` |
| All words | Spell words out; avoid abbreviations | `label`, not `lbl` |

The acronym rule has two cases: an acronym like `JSON` or `HTTP` becomes `Json`/`Http` mid-name, while a set abbreviation like `RGB` or `XYZ` stays uppercase because it stands for full words. Spell-out is a readability rule, not a length limit; prefer the clearer name even when it is longer.

## 14. Native codegen (--!native / @native)

Roblox compiler feature: server-side Luau compiles to machine code instead of VM bytecode. Best for numeric, table, and `buffer` heavy code with few library or API calls. Sources: [native code generation](https://create.roblox.com/docs/luau/native-code-gen), [Luau comments](https://create.roblox.com/docs/luau/comments). <!-- temporal: 2026-09 -->

```luau
--!native
--!optimize 2

local function kernel(v: Vector3, n: number): number
    local sum = 0
    for i = 1, n do
        sum += v.X * i
    end
    return sum
end
```

- **Scoping: server-side.** The docs describe `--!native` for server-side scripts; do not add it to client scripts expecting the documented behavior.
- `--!native` on a Script compiles all of its functions (and the top-level scope only if deemed profitable). `@native` above an individual function narrows it to that function.
- **Pair with `--!optimize 2`.** Level 2 enables optimizations that harm debuggability (Studio test default is 1, live games default to 2); the pairing is the standard native idiom.
- **Instruction ceilings** (hit = Output window error, fix by splitting functions):
  - 64K instructions in a single code block (`exceeded single code block instruction limit`)
  - 32K internal blocks in one function (`exceeded function code block limit`)
  - 1M instructions per script (`exceeded total module instruction limit`)
  - A memory limit for natively compiled code, separate from the 1M instruction ceiling; the docs warn that a natively compiled module consuming near a million instructions "takes up a lot of memory and you may exceed the memory limit."
- **No official speedup number is published.** Roblox says only that it can improve execution speed for some server scripts. Never quote a benchmark ratio as official; measure with the Script Profiler (native functions are marked) and `debug.dumpcodesize()`.
- Deoptimizers that drop functions back to the interpreter: `getfenv`/`setfenv`, builtin calls with non-numeric arguments, and passing values that violate annotated parameter types. Annotate hot parameters (especially `Vector3`) so codegen can specialize.

## 15. Review checklist

- Syntax is Luau, not JavaScript, Python, or a different Lua version.
- Only `false` and `nil` are treated as falsy.
- Valid `false` values survive fallback logic.
- Sequences are contiguous when `#`, insertion, or removal relies on that shape.
- Dictionary behavior does not depend on iteration order.
- Table aliases and shallow copies are intentional.
- Dynamic keys use bracket syntax.
- Local declaration order and closure capture are correct.
- Method definition and call syntax agree.
- Multiple return values preserve success, absence, and error states.
- String patterns are Lua patterns, not unverified regex translations.
- Removed globals (`io`, `package`, `string.dump`, absent `os` members) are treated as sandbox design, not ported from Lua 5.1 assumptions.
- Deprecated APIs use their replacements; discouraged APIs are flagged with reasons, not called silently.
- Names follow the Roblox style guide: PascalCase types/publics, camelCase locals, `LOUD_SNAKE_CASE` constants (often written UPPER_SNAKE_CASE elsewhere), first-letter-only acronyms, spelled-out words.
- Engine behavior and project architecture are routed to their canonical skills.
